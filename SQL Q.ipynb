    "A database is a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It allows multiple users to interact with the data concurrently while maintaining consistency and accuracy. A database can store various types of data, such as text, numbers, images, and videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two main types of databases, and they differ in their data storage models and querying languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined schemas. They use SQL as a standard language for querying, modifying, and managing data. SQL databases ensure data consistency and integrity by using ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. Some examples of SQL databases are MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that do not rely on predefined schemas or use SQL as a query language. Instead, they store data in a flexible, unstructured, and distributed format, such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs. NoSQL databases are scalable and can handle large amounts of data, making them suitable for big data and real-time web applications. However, they sacrifice some of the consistency and transactional properties of SQL databases to achieve scalability and performance. Some examples of NoSQL databases are MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase."

Primary Keys must be unique and not null, and they are used to enforce the integrity of the data in the table. Each table in a database should have a Primary Key, and it can be used to establish relationships with other tables in the database. For example, in a database that stores information about employees and their departments, the employee ID column can be used as the Primary Key for the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the Primary Key of another table. It is used to establish relationships between tables and ensure data consistency. The Foreign Key in one table points to the Primary Key in another table, and it can be used to enforce referential integrity between the tables. For example, in the same database that stores information about employees and their departments, the department ID column can be used as the Foreign Key in the \"employees\" table, which refers to the Primary Key in the \"departments\" table. This relationship ensures that each employee is associated with a valid department.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a relationship between tables using Primary Key and Foreign Key, the Foreign Key column in one table must reference the Primary Key column in another table. The syntax for creating a Foreign Key constraint in SQL is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "ALTER TABLE table_name\n",
    "ADD CONSTRAINT fk_constraint_name\n",
    "FOREIGN KEY (foreign_key_column) REFERENCES other_table(primary_key_column);\n",
    "In this syntax, \"table_name\" is the name of the table that contains the Foreign Key column, \"fk_constraint_name\" is a name for the Foreign Key constraint, \"foreign_key_column\" is the name of the Foreign Key column, and \"other_table\" and \"primary_key_column\" are the name of the other table and the Primary Key column that the Foreign Key column references, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Primary Key and Foreign Key are two important concepts in relational databases that help establish relationships between tables. Primary Key is a unique identifier for a row in a table, and Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the Primary Key of another table.

    "The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM: This clause identifies the table(s) from which the data will be retrieved. It specifies the table(s) and any necessary join conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHERE: This clause filters the data based on specified conditions. It specifies one or more conditions that must be met by each row of data returned by the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "GROUP BY: This clause groups the data based on specified columns. It specifies one or more columns on which to group the data, and any aggregate functions to apply to the grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAVING: This clause filters the grouped data based on specified conditions. It specifies one or more conditions that must be met by each group of data returned by the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: This clause specifies the columns to retrieve from the table(s) identified in the FROM clause. It may also include any aggregate functions to be applied to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORDER BY: This clause sorts the results based on specified columns. It specifies one or more columns on which to sort the data, and the direction (ascending or descending) in which to sort each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIMIT: This clause limits the number of rows returned by the query. It specifies the maximum number of rows to be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all clauses are required in every SQL query, and they can be used in different orders depending on the desired result. However, the order listed above is the most common and is generally followed for clarity and ease of understanding."
